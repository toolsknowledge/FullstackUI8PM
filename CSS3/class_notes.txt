Introduction to CSS
*******************

CSS Stands for Cascading Style Sheet

CSS Used to apply the styles to the static webpages

current version of CSS is CSS3.0

<style></style> tag used to include the CSS to webpages

Ex.
    <html>
        <head>
            <style>
                //CSS
            </style>
        </head>

        <body></body>
    </html>

style attribute used to write the inline css

    <p style="color:red">Hello</p>


<link> tag, used to link the external style sheets

Ex.
    <html>
        <head>
            <link rel="stylesheet" href="file1.css">
        </head>
        <body></body>
    </html>




Positions
*********
   CSS Supports following Positions

    1) relative position

    2) absolute position

    3) fixed position

    4) static position

    5) sticky position


relative position
*****************
        moving particular element from origin called as relative position



Media Queries
*************
    Execution of webpages into multiple devices called as Responsive Web Design

    Responsive Web Design also called as Media Queries

    to reuse styles we need variables and functions.

    but veraible and functions not supported by CSS.

    variables and functions supported by SCSS

    SCSS also called as Preprocessor of CSS

    we will save the scss files with .scss extension

    in general, browsers won't understand SCSS.

    so, we must convert SCSS to Equalent CSS.

    we will convert SCSS to CSS with the Live Sass Compiler.
